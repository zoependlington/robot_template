1. run `./template.sh <template file> <output file>`
     - Here, the <template file> is your ROBOT template that has been completed and <output file> is your desired output. For example, if I had a template file, template.tsv, and a desired output of output.owl:
          - `./template.sh template.tsv output.owl`
